# MOCA_addons
Some much needed basic addons to the Blue Yonder (BY) JDA MOCA platform.

# Commands
These are commands that don't come with the base product that I've found to be useful when trouble-shooting issues with the WMS Client. Drop the folder or clone to your $LESDIR/src/cmdsrc/ folder. Be careful about cloning, as if you build commands off this repo then if they are changed or deleted it could break a custom command you developed after server restart/mbuild.
